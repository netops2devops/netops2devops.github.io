# Hello world

Welcome to my blog. My name is Kapil Agrawal (pronunciation: `cup-ill`) and I am a *Security Engineer* by profession. My current role mostly focuses on Network security, DevSecOps and developing security tools and automating workflows for security operations. Prior to moving into a Cybersecurity role, I was a Network Engineer and had several years of experience working in service provider and HPC data center networking and automation. I have many interests most of which involve Linux, networking, security, software, Infrastucture as code. In my downtime I enjoy hiking, kayaking or working out (HIIT), gaming, traveling or playing with Juniper (my cat).

## Motivation

Since I rely heavily on Open source and the work that others put out online for free, I wanted to do my due diligence and share some of the cool stuff that I get to learn and work on which I usually end up documenting somewhere in my notes anyway. My hope is that someone on the internet could benefit from the information here plus it helps me work on my technical writing skills and also gives me a good reason to finally start using this domain that I have been squatting on for so long.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find the articles in this blog helpful.

Ciao! ðŸ‘‹
