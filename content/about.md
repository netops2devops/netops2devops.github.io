# Hello world

Welcome to my blog. My name is Kapil Agrawal (pronunciation: `cup-ill`) and I am a *Security Engineer* by profession. These days I mostly focus on things involving Kubernetes networking and security. I also have an extensive background in network operations and infrastructure automation. Generally speaking, I like to live at the intersection of networking, systems, software & security. In my downtime I go hiking or kayaking, traveling or staying home gaming, working in my homelab or playing with Juniper (my cat).

## Motivation

Since I rely heavily on Open source and the work that others put out online for free, I wanted to do my due diligence and share some of the cool stuff that I get to learn and work on which I usually end up documenting somewhere in my notes anyway. My hope is that someone on the internet could benefit from the information here and it also gives me a good reason to finally start using this domain that I have been squatting on for so long. I am super passionate about learning and sharing.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find the articles in this blog helpful.

Ciao! 👋
