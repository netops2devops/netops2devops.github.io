# Hello world

Welcome to my blog. I am a Platform Security Engineer by profession. I also have an extensive background in Network Engineering and Infrastructure automation. Generally speaking, I enjoy learning and working at the intersection of networking, systems, software & security. During my downtime I enjoy amateur boxing, working on my homelab, traveling, hiking or kayaking.

I’m deeply passionate about learning and sharing. Having benefited immensely from open source, both personally and professionally, I figured it’s time to give back by writing about some of the projects I’ve been tinkering with which I document somewhere in my Obsidian notes anyway. If even one person finds this helpful, I would consider that to be a win and it’s also a great reason to finally make use of this domain that I’ve been squatting on for so long 😄

Thanks for stopping by.

Ciao! 👋
