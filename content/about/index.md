# Hello world

Welcome to my blog. I am a Platform Security Engineer by profession. I also have an extensive background in Network Engineering and Infrastructure automation. Generally speaking, I enjoy learning and working at the intersection of networking, systems, software & security. During my downtime I enjoy amateur boxing, working on my homelab, traveling, hiking or kayaking.

I am really passionate about learning and sharing. Since I rely heavily on open source and the work that others put out online for free, I wanted to share some of the cool stuff that I get to learn and work on which I usually end up documenting somewhere in my notes anyway. My hope is that someone on the internet could benefit from the information here and it also gives me a good reason to finally start using this domain that I have been squatting on for so long.

Thanks for stopping by.

Ciao! ðŸ‘‹
