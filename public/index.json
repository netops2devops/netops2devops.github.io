My name is Kapil Agrawal (pronunciation: cup-ill) and I am a Security Engineer by profession. These days I mostly focus on things involving Kubernetes networking and security. I also have an extensive background in network operations and infrastructure automation. Generally speaking, I work at the intersection of networking, systems, software \u0026amp; security. During my downtime I enjoy being around nature by hiking/kayaking, traveling.\nMotivation # Since I rely heavily on Open source and the work that others put out online for free, I wanted to do my due diligence and share some of the cool stuff that I get to learn and work on which I usually end up documenting somewhere in my notes anyway. My hope is that someone on the internet could benefit from the information here and it also gives me a good reason to finally start using this domain that I have been squatting on for so long. I am super passionate about learning and sharing.\nThanks for stopping by. I hope you find the articles in this blog helpful.\nCiao! ðŸ‘‹\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
